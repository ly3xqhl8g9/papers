Delayed Arrival of Meaning and Meaningful Time-Travel


a thousand and ten

a thousand and one

a thousand and one hundred and ten and one




I say to you: the code is one thousand… and one

making a pause after saying thousand to catch a breath


in that pause, your mental model is fixed on the number 1,000, as soon as I add “and one” your mental model switches to 1,001, and it makes you think that you always had in mind the number 1,001 and never had 1,000 - this is the mark of succesful meaning transmission, and in this specific case “a thousand and one” the transmission and the parsing are done automatically



to distinguish between succesful data transmission (I send 01 and you receive 01 and I know that you have received it) and succesful meaning transmission (I say ‘water’ and you understand ‘water’ and I know that you understand ‘water’, that is, that you think of something that can be drinked when thirsty, even if you think of a waterlake and I of a waterfall)



If I say to you: “a thousand and ten”, the meaning is still there, you understand the number 1,010


If I am a bad English speaker, trying to say the number 1,111 (eleven hundreds eleven), I might say to you: a thousand and one hundred and ten and one.

Let’s break this into 4 chunks

a thousand
and one hundred
and ten
and one


What happens in your mind as I say each chunk, provided that the meaning transmission is succesful


chunk 		spoken				understood		misunderstood						misunderstanding rate
0			a thousand			1,000			-									?? how to compute

1			and one hundred		1,100			1,000 and 100

2			and ten				1,110			1,000 and 100 and 10

3			and one				1,111			1,000 and 100 and 10 and 1



However, due to the fact that the construction is somewhat unusual to the natural speaker after each chunk the probability of misunderstanding increases due to the lingering effect of the previous meaning

I say “a thousand” and 1,000 is created in your meaning


I say “and one hundred” and 100 is created in your meaning, but, unlike in the case of “a thousand and one”, the 1,000 lingers in the meaning and is not automatically joined with the 100 to form 1,100



What could “a thousand and one hundred and ten and one” be misunderstood with?

Instead of a number, 1,100, to misunderstand an enumeration, or even a countdown (the context here is highly important, for example, if I am trying to say the number 1,100, and you expect or are simply parallelthinking of some kind of code with a specific format, and I don’t know that format)

Instead of a number, 1,100, to simply not understand anything, just a meaningless list of integers






How to compute the misunderstanding rate?


fully understand is 1000

no understanding is 0



based on the number of possible misunderstanding dimensions to generate a fuzzy number?


how do you count the misunderstanding directions/dimensions


if I say “one thousand” - the misunderstanding is infinite because there is not enough context


if I say “one thousand and one” - the misunderstanding should be countable


misunderstanding dimension one: “one thousand and one” - as in 1,001 certain items in a certain state

misunderstanding dimension two: “one thousand and one” - as in the story “One Thousand and One Nights’
