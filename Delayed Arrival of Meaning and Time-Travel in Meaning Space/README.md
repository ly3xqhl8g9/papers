# Delayed Arrival of Meaning <br /> and Time-Travel in Meaning Space



Information transfer is sequential. This is a universe-based constraint. Meaning processing is sequential -> One can envision a parallel mode of meaning processing, however, due to the current lack of meaning representation, it is unclear if parallel modes would produce a coherent meaning entity. Information transfer can be considered as data transfer and meaning transfer. Data can be measured in bytes, meaning can be measured in mytes*. Meaning processing happens during and after the data transfer. Solving for meaning a certain data transfer means that the meaning is formed in layers, each one delaying the solvency, and that the final layer performs a final time-travel transforming or not the meaning altogether. The final layer can be the last layer generated after the meaning processing, but since meaning is attention-driven, the final layer is the last layer that receives attention before the meaning is settled.


\* to think more of the Unit of Meaning, for now just a play on the word [b/m]ytes;

The nature of a myte is unclear, however it is clear that the mapping is not necessarily 1 to 1, that is 1 byte might not be equal to 1 myte. A myte is inherently a probabilistic unit. 100 bytes might represent 1 myte, or might not.


The question is, if given a certain amount of megabytes of data, which for the source represent another certain amount of megamytes of meaning, if the source were to transfer the megabytes of data, would the target be able to reconstruct the certain amount of megamytes that the source represented.


Example: I am the source and I hold 2 megabytes of data representing for me 0.2 megamytes of meaning. I am transferring the 2 megabytes of data through the network. They reach the target, and the target communicates that the 2 megabytes of data were succesfully received using the network. How could the target reconstruct the 0.2 megamytes of meaning? How did I originally construct the 0.2 megamytes of meaning?


A myte cannot be transferred through the network, only the underlying data can be transferred. A myte is to be constructed on the source and reconstructed on the target. Meaning transfer achieved in this manner cannot be a lossless transfer. The question is if the lost meaning can be mitigated to reach a succesful action anyway.


Example: consider a car with a driver and a passenger in the front row of seats. The car reaches a cross-walk. On the sidewalk there is a pedestrian which seems ready to cross, somewhat unaware of the coming car. The passenger in the car notices (transforms the visual data of the pedestrian into enough meaning) the unawareness of the pedestrian, the driver does not notice (the transform of the visual data from the pedestrian does not achieve the same meaning as in the passenger). Considering this scenario, some events could happen:

+ the driver stops the car because of the training to stop at the cross-walk when there is a pedestrian on the side.
+ the passenger shouts "Stop!" without any other explanation and the driver stops the car because the new data (the "Stop!") re-transforms the original data of the pedestrian into a meaningful stop situation/action.
+ the driver does not stop, but the pedestrian becomes aware of the car and stops walking
+ the driver does not stop, the passenger does not shout, the pedestrian does not stop, and there is an accident
